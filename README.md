# SAIL-Application
This is my entire application to Q14 on the form for UNC Sports Analytics Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL). I have chosen to use the Andrew Sundbergâ€™s 
College Basketball Dataset via Kaggle dataset, and I chose to find variables that can predict teams' performance in the NCAA March Madness Tournament using
Backward Selection, Lasso, and Ridge regression models. The SAIL rmd file is the code for the project written in R, which includes the Exploratory Data 
Analysis and the regression models used in this project. In addition, the SAIL Report file is a HTML file that has been knitted from R Markdown.
