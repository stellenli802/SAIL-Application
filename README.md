# Sports Analytics
This is my entire program for the sports analytics project I have done. I chose to use the Andrew Sundbergâ€™s College Basketball Dataset via Kaggle dataset, and I chose to find variables that can predict teams' performance in the NCAA March Madness Tournament using Backward Selection, Lasso, and Ridge regression models. The SAIL rmd file is the code for the project written in R, which includes the Exploratory Data Analysis and the regression models used in this project.
